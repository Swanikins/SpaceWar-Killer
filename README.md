This works by scanning for any folders with OnlineFix.ini and then allowing you to change the fake app ID with no hassle, you can change your entire "acquired" library to act as a single game to Steam for whatever reason, from wanting to collect more hours in a game and not having 1k hours in Spacewar like me....
To not looking like a brokie to your friends. If there are any issues please post them in "Issues" and I will *deal* with them. 

Enjoy!
